# Bootstrapping results

## What is done

An investigation of a vehicle fleet substitution ready for an organization is displayed. The information for dataprogressing  is MPG of the cars tested by the company with some old cars and also the substitutioed new cars.The information has been broke down and distinctive plotting have been made. The results incorporates standard deviation and bootstrapping.

## STD comparison via the boostrap

### Old fleet

- std-mean = 6.40180546218

Mean:
- mean = 20.144578

-- Median: 15.000000
-- Var: 17.391764
-- std: 4.170343
-- MAD: 2.000000


### New fleet
